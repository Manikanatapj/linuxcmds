Linux cp --backup
1.	cp --backup <filename> <destinationDirectory>

Linux Copy Multiple Files or Directories
1.	cp *.<extension> <destinationDirectory>  
Example:
1.	cp *.txt /home/sssit/Documents 

 find . -mtime +10 | xargs ls –l

 To view a common log file called /var/log/messages use any one of the following command:
# less /var/log/messages
# more -f /var/log/messages
# cat /var/log/messages	
# tail -f /var/log/messages
# grep -i error /var/log/messages

The procedure to monitor and display open ports in Linux is as follows:
1.	Open a Linux terminal application
2.	Use ss command to display all open TCP and UDP ports in Linux.
3.	Another option is to use the netstat command to list all ports in Linux.
4.	Apart from ss/netstat one can use the lsof command to list open files and ports on Linux based system.
5.	Finally, one can use nmap command to check TCP and UDP ports too.
Let us see all commands and examples in details.

To c last executed commands

If you wish to view the history one page at a time, you can use the command below. Now, you can simply use the spacebar to view one page at a time or use the down arrow to view one line at a time:

history | less

To view just the last ten commands, you can use the following:

history | tail

To view the last 25 commands, just use the following:

history 25

Another tool you can use with history is Ctrl + R. This will output a search feature. Just begin typing a command and it will complete the command with the most recent match. If it is not the one you need, simply type a few more letters until you find the command you wanted. Once you find it, simply press the return key to run or press the right arrow key to edit it.

Another way to search history is with the following command (just be sure to replace "searchterm"):
history | grep -i searchterm | less
As you can see, the history command can be very useful in finding the last commands that have been used on your (mt) Media Temple service.

If the user has changed their prompt to some other format we need to try something else. The who command will give us the information we are looking for.

who

You can get the same one-word answer by echoing the $USER environment variable to the screen.

echo $USER

The one-letter command w requires less typing and provides more information.
w
